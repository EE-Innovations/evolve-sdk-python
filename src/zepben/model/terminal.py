    """
    A terminal is a connection point on a piece of ConductingEquipment. All ConductingEquipment must have terminals and
    all terminals must have an associated piece of ConductingEquipment.

    Note: If you are extending this class you must ensure you always safely access the linked equipment (i.e, check it is
    not None)

    Attributes:
        - equipment : A reference back to the equipment this Terminal belongs to. This reference will typically
                      be added in :class:`zepben.model.ConductingEquipment::__init__()`.
        - phases : A :class:`zepben.cim.iec61970.PhaseCode` representing the normal network phasing condition of this
                   Terminal.
        - connected : The connected status is related to a bus-branch model and the topological node to terminal relation.
                      True implies the terminal is connected to the related topological node and false implies it is not.
                      In a bus-branch model, the connected status is used to tell if equipment is disconnected without having to change
                      the connectivity described by the topological node to terminal relation. A valid case is that conducting
                      equipment can be connected in one end and open in the other. In particular for an AC line segment,
                      where the reactive line charging can be significant, this is a relevant case.
